### Reverse Engineering Write ups

This repo contains write ups detailing how I approached and solved various reverse engineering related challenges/crackmes.
They mostly involve x86/64 Windows PE files but may sometimes be about powershell, javascript, pyc and documents such as PDFs and OLE files etc.

Done:

- Root-Me KeygenMe PE32+
- Root-Me PE x64 UEFI Secure Boot

Other solved challenges a write up about which is expected:

- Root-Me RunPE (Windows x86)
- Root-Me SEHVEH
